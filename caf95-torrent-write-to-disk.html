Disk Cache Override automatic cache size and specify the size manually allows you to set a new maximum memory usage for the disk cache. Normally, µTorrent automatically adjusts the cache size based on your current download speed. This value is interpreted in MiB, so please enter it as such. Any value below 1 will be ignored, and 1 will be used instead. Reduce memory usage when cache is not needed flushes unused parts of the disk cache when µTorrent is not transferring data.

Hey everyone! amp#x200B; I've been downloading a lot of large files recently, and qBitorrent is horribly fragmenting the HDD I am writing to. amp#x200B; It's an 8TB drive, and after downloading \~2TB in torrents, I had almost 3 million fragments. I'm in the process of defragging the drive right now but it is taking absolutely forever (multiple days), with read/write speeds around 15-20MB/s. amp#x200B; Is there a way I can prevent qBitorrent from doing this in the future? Ideally.

TL;DR: Today I fucked up royally by "burning" the Solus linux distro over my 4TB archive disk – not with dd – but with the most user friendly GUI ever, Etcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/). I need some advice before doing something potentially (even more) stupid! The moral of the story so far is to never leave any external disks plugged in while you write ISO's to USB drives! The full story: I had just started having some nerdy fun by using an old MacBook4,1 to test out some distros.

I'm having problems with the SkyrimSE Repack on the official Fitgirl page, SFV gives 11 missing files as it seems that the installer is not extracting some files.

I'm running Arch linux. Steam has been giving me disk write errors whenever I try to update games with my library on my external hard drive, and some of my downloading torrents are saying input/output errors. I'm really hoping this isn't drive failure, I have about 3 terabytes of media on here. Here's my dmesg output: 730.748156 usb 2-2: USB disconnect, device number 2 732.408067 usb 2-1: new SuperSpeed Gen 1 USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd 732.428901 tl;dr: what filesystem should I be running on my new home server and why? do I have to invest in ecc ram? am I missing anything that could make my setup better? specific context: the current production setup: I currently have a Thecus N7700 Pro that i've added a vga port to, pulled the DOM, and now boot ubuntu server on via usb flash drive (/boot is on usb / is on the array because the backplane isn't bootable on this box). At this point, it's just a core2duo I'm new here and been lurking for a few weeks reading this and that but I'm still confused with most things (one of the proof is I only recently learned that Mac, windows, linux, freenas OSs use different file systems such as ntfs, zfs, exfat, omv etc and there is no(?) way to backup between these in a nondestructive way. Until now I'm still not sure if way I'm saying is right). Here I am, ready to dip my foot in this deep ocean, and want to build my own Personal Server and don't know myself. Never had issues with Fit Girl repacks before, this is the first time. Every time I try to install, installation goes to 2% and this error pops up: https://i.imgur.com/7YtT7ZD.png (https://i.imgur.com/7YtT7ZD.png) I went trough all FitGirl's troubleshooting pages, rehashed a torrent couple of times, verified installation files couple of times, disabled windows defender, tried to install with 4GB RAM limitation and without it (My PC has 16GB), defrag'ed my HDD. Nothing seems to help, still. I saw in another thread people asking about the rules.

Hello dear hoarders. I just bought two 8tb Barracudas. I thoroughly read the spec sheet but at no point does it mention the disk is SMR. If you remember the good ol' archive drive - its data sheet has like a dedicated section on SMR: https://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/hdd-fam/seagate-archive-hdd/en-us/docs/100795782a.pdf it details the zones, how big the PMR zone is and all sorts of juicy info. Now check the documentation for the barracudas: https://www.seagate.com/www-content. The Problem: I'm a bit of a datahoarder, poor, and a Canadian. This means stacks of 8tb HD's are not cheaply available in the form of WD Easystors. I've grown my storage organically over the years, primarily utilizing large whitebox servers and whatever hard drives I can find on sale. I've always protected my data with SnapRAID, pooled with MergerFS, and this has worked pretty well in recovering from drive failures while presenting my media library simply to Plex etc. This worked Hi there. My name’s Dan, not that this really matters. It’s my friend Alex, who left this Earth but a few days ago, that I want to write about. He wasn’t a dear friend of mine. He wasn’t particularly charming or engaging. He wasn’t even a good man. But I have accessed his diary of the events following his death, and, by God, will I release it.

So I have a box for learning ZFS among other experimentation. I've been using it to host public domain torrents, but I've been bumping into a random-read IO bottleneck. It's currently running 12 x 3 TB drives as one pool, in mirrored vdevs. RAM in the machine is maxed at 16 GB. I'm getting about 20 to 25 MB/s of throughput, and tools such as nmon show the disks saturated with read IOPS. Record size for BitTorrent is ideally 16 KB, but the dataset currently has a 128 KB record size (isn't Hi, yes this is a repost, I've made this guide one month ago, when I released it was horrible but with the great help with this comunity I fixed most problems in this guide and added more things.

Almost 150 years ago Alfred Russel Wallace won a £500 bet (£44,000 in today's money) against John Hampden by proving the curvature of the Bedford Level, as determined by an impartial judge who was agreed on beforehand by both parties. John Hampden rejected the judgement and insisted his own judge, William Carpenter (a publisher of Flat Earth literature and paid lecturer on the subject), had seen no curvature and so he refused to pay. He then launched a years-long harassment and libel campaign. I'm trying to download something, but after 0.5% of download it stops and saves only 0.1%. There are a lot of seeders. I have tried deleting the files and starting again, but it is still the same. Tried other file to download and it works perfectly. Please help, thanks ampnbsp; edit: status says- Error: WriteToDisk: illegal byte sequence OS MacOS High Sierra, uTorrent 1.8.7 (newest), on SSD, it works for 5 or less seconds and then it stops. Source for code (https://pyrocore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto.html#moving-all-data-for-selected-items-to-a-new-location) If this is a duplicate, apologies; I searched but mostly found people using Automove. If you have Couchpotato, Sonarr/Radarr, etc. you probably have them downloading into a folder that's different from where your media is stored and indexed. This is one way to fix that. I wasn't happy with Sonarr and Radarr's built-in post-processing, as they could So my setup is running on an old Windows Server 2012. I use Sonarr, Radarr, qbittorrent and a bunch of trackers that still favor rar releases. Since some downloads are in rar that neither Sonarr or Radarr manages to process I butchered and pasted together bits of PowerShell-code to get a more or less working download handling script. So what does it do? It grabs a bunch of parameters from qbittorrent, like Torrent Name, Torrent Folder and so on. It looks for rar-files in the torrent folder. This error keeps coming whenever I download a torrent file about cyclic redundancy check (write to disk). I tried to download the same file on another hard drive and the torrent file downloaded smoothly, without any errors. I ran chkdsk on the drive on which it was having CRC error but the results were clear, that no errors were found. I checked w/ HDDScan and it said that bad sectors are present on the HD. I don’t understand as the old data on that hard drive is running w/o any problem 
Hi people, So after running out of space on my 1,5 TB PC, I hurled into disk reviews and after about a month I bought myself this Hgst Ultrastar He8 Huh728060ale600 6 Tb 3.5" Internal Hard Drive - Sata - 7200 This disk I had for past 1,5 year, and last month it started showing death signs. Reading is OK, but when writing larger files (or downloading torrent) the disk just halts wtih 100% utilization and slowly, periodically clicks. It sucks bigtime, considering I only ever managed </p>
